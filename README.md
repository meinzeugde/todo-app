# todo-app

## Why?

The need for developing the millionth todo-app originates from the need to showcase some developing skills.
The task was to create a todo application with Javascript and Bootstrap.
Sounds simple? Well, it would be, if not for my high demand on creating the best todo-app ever made...in approximately 8 hours and without further research on what's already existing!

## Tribute

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1...which saved me a lot of time bootstrapping the app.

## Build and Development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

In order to compile SASS, you'll need to have Ruby installed.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
